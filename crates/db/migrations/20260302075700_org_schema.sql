-- ORG
-- =========================
--
-- Multi-tenant organization model.
--
-- Concepts:
--   - orgs: tenant/accounts
--   - org_memberships: users belong to orgs with a role
--   - org_invitations: invitation flow for adding members
--
-- Invariants:
--   - Each org must always have an owner
--   - At most one owner per org (enforced by partial unique index)
--   - At least one owner per org (enforced by deferred constraint triggers)
--
-- Notes:
--   - The "must have an owner" checks are DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED so
--     org creation can happen in one transaction:
--       INSERT orgs ...
--       INSERT org_memberships ... role='owner'
--     and the constraint is checked at COMMIT.
--
-- UUID generation:
--   - uuidv7() assumed available (Postgres 18 / uuidv7 extension), producing
--     time-ordered UUIDs.
